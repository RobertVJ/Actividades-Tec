A note before what is relevant to the activity:

My code probably won't work inside an anaconda environment, and the rationale for it is as follows:
After several days of attempts and failures in anaconda with python 3.9, I decided to first carry out the activity 
in the web application  called Colab, due to the time spent by the failed attempt to raise the environment in anaconda, as well,
I am more familiar with this tool than the browser anaconda.

That said, I already left the instructions in this repository to be able to run them within the colab 
environment as well as having the possibility of running them in an anaconda environment with 
the necessary libraries installations in each of the activities.

Now, in this Githhub repository you will find the following:

* A code for each activity carried out in Python, as well as a Colab link with its exact "copy" with the results given in carrying out these activities

* .env call requirement for anaconda

* activities datasets divide on folder of each activity

The links of the exercises performed on Colab website are the following:

* [NLP Activity 1](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UL1mgOP_OqeVIOYX-8o4r78LwjVk8rJT?usp=sharing)


* [NLP Activity 2](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jEpsNeJAjC1rguMuMegubyoEW7B07kAu?usp=sharing)


* [NLP Activity 3](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PJo2oprQouYvKGkd09c6ztz22rl1mR_0?usp=sharing)
* [NLP Activity 3 Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pwgr0sX75yne9hQE_6ySqIDRsLk5OBSH?usp=sharing)

In case you need to run the codes made in colab, 
the only thing necessary for its functionality 
would be to load within the environment the dataset 
used by activity for the functionality of the code
