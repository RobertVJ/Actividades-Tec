A note before what is relevant to the activity:

Once the feedback of the NLP activity of module 3 was seen, the arrangements of the variables were given, 
the imports were moved to the upper part of the code, without counting the first "comment" where the 
instructions of said activity come from, finally also fixed the requirments.txt for use in the activity.

That said, I already left the instructions in this repository to be able to run them within the colab 
environment as well as having the possibility of running them in an anaconda environment with 
the necessary libraries installations in each of the activities.

Now, in this Githhub repository you will find the following:

* A code for each activity carried out in Python, as well as a Colab link with its exact "copy" with the results given in carrying out these activities

* .env call requirement for anaconda

* activities datasets divide on folder of each activity

The links of the exercises performed on Colab website are the following:

* [NLP Activity 1](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UL1mgOP_OqeVIOYX-8o4r78LwjVk8rJT?usp=sharing)


* [NLP Activity 2](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jEpsNeJAjC1rguMuMegubyoEW7B07kAu?usp=sharing)


* [NLP Activity 3](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PJo2oprQouYvKGkd09c6ztz22rl1mR_0?usp=sharing)


In case you need to run the codes made in colab, 
the only thing necessary for its functionality 
would be to load within the environment the dataset 
used by activity for the functionality of the code
